Cleaning and Exploration of Ebay Car Sales Data

We'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a [classifieds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data). 
We've made a few modifications from the original dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle, also 50,000 data points was sampled from the full dataset
